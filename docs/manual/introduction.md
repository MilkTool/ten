# <a name="1">1 - Introduction</a>
Ten is an efficient, lightweight scripting language designed from the
ground up to be embedded in other programs.  While the language is
inherently procedural, it provides the tools necessary for working
in any of the popular paradigms, and borrows a lot of ideas from more
functional languages.

Ten is implemented as a library written in standard C code.  The core
language implementation includes a minimal prelude library as well as
the interpreter itself.  The project also includes a simple command
line interface to the Ten language, which links to the library to
provide a full script interpreter with an interactive REPL.

Ten is free software, licensed under the liberal MIT License.
