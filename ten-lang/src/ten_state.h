// The way Ten's VM is setup, we're gonna be long jumping up the
// stack whenever an error occurs; this is efficient for error
// handling, but can lead to some loose ends as far as memory
// allocations and other resource managment goes if we long jump
// at the wrong times.  So to allow these jumps in a safe way without
// chance of a memory or resource leak we define two types: Part
// and Defer.
//
// The Part type is for allocating memory, it represents
// an incomplete object or raw memory allocation; providing access
// to the allocated memory with the condition that, should an error
// jump occur before the memory is committed (with another function
// call) it will be released automatically.  Object allocations also
// are not added to the GC list until committed, this gives us time
// to ensure the object is initialized to a valid GC state without
// worrying about the possibility of a cycle.
//
// The Defer type basically just allows us to register an arbitrary
// callback to be invoked in case of an error.  The callback
// is passed a pointer to the Defer itself; so the defer is expected
// to be extended with any other data it needs to perform its task.
//
// Both of these types are typically allocated on the native stack
// and linked into the state.  So if we forget to commit or otherwise
// unlink them before the call frame they're allocated in is popped
// the pointers can become corrupted; causing issues with the entire
// list.  So in debug builds we prefix and postfix these with magic
// numbers, which we validate regularly to check for corruption, and
// add some fields for keeping track of where the struct was installed
// from.
