// This component implements the Index type, which serves as the
// lookup table used to tie record keys to specific slots in the
// group of records that link to it.  Multiple records can share
// a single Index, this lends to efficiency, but means that care
// must be taken in the way records are used to avoid polluting
// the Index with keys since all records that link to an Index
// must provide the same number of value slots as there were keys
// in the Index when the record was created or when it last added
// a new key to the Index.

// The Index type just maps Ten values (used as keys) to
// locators used as offsets in the value array of records.
// But it's implemented in a bit of an unusual way in an
// attempt to improve locality of reference when on lookup.
//
// We use an open addressed hashmap for lookups, so there's
// no array of linked lists as in the more popular design;
// there's just one long array of key-value pairs.  But
// there's a twist, we add a stepLimit and a stepTarget.  The
// stepLimit is the largest gap between a key's position
// in the Index and its ideal position; so it's also the
// largest number of array slots (after the first) that'll
// be checked when searching for an existing key.  This
// limit can increase when a new key is added, but will be
// reset to stepTarget when the Index changes size, thus
// the stepLimit will always tend toward the stepTarget.
//
// The stepTarget ultimately determines the space vs time
// overhead tradeoff balance for the Index.  In general
// we'll increase the stepTarget for larger Index sizes
// and decrease it for smaller sizes; this ensures that
// the more common smaller Indexes are fast, but the
// larger ones aren't prohibitively expensive in terms
// of memory.
//
// See (TODO: Add Link) for more on the common designs
// for hash maps.
//
// See (TODO: Add Link) for more on the design used by
// this Index implementation in particular.
