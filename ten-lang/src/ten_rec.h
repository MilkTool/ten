// This component implements the  Record object type, which is
// basically just an array of values linked to an Index.  New
// fields defined in a Record will be added to its Index, fields
// redefined to `udf` are removed; at least this is how the Record
// sees it, in reality the Index keeps a ref count for each key
// and increments when a key is added or decrements when removed.
